# Lab04-Tic-Tac-Toe

## About this project
This program is a tic-tac-toe game. The game is initialized by using separate class files to create a new game and new user. Once the game starts, the user names for player one and two are stored. The players then take turns playing tic-tac-toe until there is a winner, or a draw. The user inputs are stored as separate strings, which are evaluated against the winning conditions each turn.
